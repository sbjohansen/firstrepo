                <h1>Patti Smith - Becouse the Night</h1>
            
                Take me now, baby, here as I am
                Pull me close, try and understand
                Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
                Love is a banquet on which we feed

                Come on now, try and understand
                The way I feel when I'm in your hands
                Take my hand, come undercover
                They can't hurt you now
                Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now

                Because the night belongs to lovers
                Because the night belongs to lust
                Because the night belongs to lovers
                Because the night belongs to us

                Have I doubt when I'm alone
                Love is a ring, the telephone
                Love is an angel disguised as lust
                Here in our bed until the morning comes

                Come on now, try and understand
                The way I feel under your command
                Take my hand as the sun descends
                They can't touch you now
                Can't touch you now, can't touch you now

                Because the night belongs to lovers
                Because the night belongs to lust
                Because the night belongs to lovers
                Because the night belongs to us

                With love we sleep
                With doubt the vicious circle
                Turns and burns
                Without you, oh, I cannot live
                Forgive, the yearning burning
                I believe it's time, too real to feel

                So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now

                Because the night belongs to lovers
                Because the night belongs to lust
                Because the night belongs to lovers
                Because the night belongs to us

                Because tonight there are two lovers
                If we believe in the night we trust
                Because the night belongs to lovers
                Because the night belongs to lust

                Because the night
                Belongs to lovers
                Because the night
                Belongs to us
                'Cause we believe tonight we're lovers
                'Cause we believe, in the night we trust
                Because the night belongs to lovers
