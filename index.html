                <p>Take me now, baby, here as I am<br>
                Pull me close, try and understand<br>
                Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe<br>
                Love is a banquet on which we feed</p>

                <p>Come on now, try and understand<br>
                The way I feel when I'm in your hands<br>
                Take my hand, come undercover<br>
                They can't hurt you now<br>
                Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now</p>

                <p>Because the night belongs to lovers<br>
                Because the night belongs to lust<br>
                Because the night belongs to lovers<br>
                Because the night belongs to us</p>

                <p>Have I doubt when I'm alone<br>
                Love is a ring, the telephone<br>
                Love is an angel disguised as lust<br>
                Here in our bed until the morning comes</p>

                <p>Come on now, try and understand<br>
                The way I feel under your command<br>
                Take my hand as the sun descends<br>
                They can't touch you now<br>
                Can't touch you now, can't touch you now</p>

                <p>Because the night belongs to lovers<br>
                Because the night belongs to lust<br>
                Because the night belongs to lovers<br>
                Because the night belongs to us</p>

                <p>With love we sleep<br>
                With doubt the vicious circle<br>
                Turns and burns<br>
                Without you, oh, I cannot live<br>
                Forgive, the yearning burning<br>
                I believe it's time, too real to feel</p>

                <p>So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now</p>

                <p>Because the night belongs to lovers<br>
                Because the night belongs to lust<br>
                Because the night belongs to lovers<br>
                Because the night belongs to us</p>

                <p>Because tonight there are two lovers<br>
                If we believe in the night we trust<br>
                Because the night belongs to lovers<br>
                Because the night belongs to lust</p>

                <p>Because the night<br>
                Belongs to lovers<br>
                Because the night<br>
                Belongs to us<br>
                'Cause we believe tonight we're lovers<br>
                'Cause we believe, in the night we trust<br>
                Because the night belongs to lovers</p>
